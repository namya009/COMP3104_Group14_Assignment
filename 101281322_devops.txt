    DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that 
increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high 
velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using
 traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.

    The word DevOps is a combination of the terms development and operations, meant to
 represent a collaborative or shared approach to the tasks performed by a company's 
 application development and IT operations teams. In its broadest meaning, DevOps 
 is a philosophy that promotes better communication and collaboration between these 
 teams -- and others -- in an organization. In its most narrow interpretation, 
 DevOps describes the adoption of iterative software development, automation and 
 programmable infrastructure deployment and maintenance. The term also covers 
 culture changes, such as building trust and cohesion between developers and systems 
 administrators and aligning technological projects to business requirements. 
 DevOps can change the software delivery chain, services, job roles, IT tools and 
 best practices.
