A DevOps engineer is an IT professional who works with software developers, 
system operators (SysOps) and other production IT staff to oversee code releases 
and deployments.

DevOps is all about the blend of development and operations. It is an ethos that 
underlines the significance of cooperation and correspondence between software 
engineers and creation IT specialists while mechanizing the usage of software and 
framework changes.
