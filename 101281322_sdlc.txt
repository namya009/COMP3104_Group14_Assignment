    A DevOps engineer is an IT professional who works with software developers, 
system operators (SysOps) and other production IT staff to oversee code releases 
and deployments.

    DevOps is all about the blend of development and operations. It is an ethos that 
underlines the significance of cooperation and correspondence between software 
engineers and creation IT specialists while mechanizing the usage of software and 
framework changes.

    DevOps is a smart career option in today's world. DevOps promotes a culture of 
trust between team members and risk-sharing. It encourages teams to continuously 
experiment to improve the company's products and services. Researches have also 
shown that in the coming years DevOps will be the main hiring criteria for 46% of 
the IT companies.

All the benefits of DevOps translate into reduced general costs and requirements of 
IT staff. Few technical points which I would like to highlight about DevOps benefits:

DevOps development teams reduce IT costs by 30% lower.
DevOps helps organizations need to both deliver new features and maintain stability.

With the advent of DevOps, the team at the operation level do not have to wait for finding an error and then fix it.
