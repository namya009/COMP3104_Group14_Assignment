GBC- Georgebrown college.

I go to the CasaLoma campus. 
They offer many different programs ranging from business to childcare to hospitality/culinary arts as well as Computer science and technology.
Bachelor of Interpretation – American Sign Language – English
Bachelor of Applied Arts – Early Childhood Leadership
Early Childhood Education (Consecutive Diploma/Degree)
Bachelor of Science in Nursing
Bachelor of Commerce – Financial Services
Bachelor of Commerce – Culinary Management
Bachelor of Business Administration – Hospitality
Bachelor of Technology – Construction Management

My program is T127 (Computer programmer and analyst)

So for my program during the first two years of the program, we develop the skills and 
techniques required for software application development and testing. The industry
tells us they are looking for Computer Programmer Analysts with “the total package.”
So the third year includes advanced technical skills in areas such as systems 
analysis and design techniques – and continues to develop communications, 
teamwork and other client service skills such as needs assessment, sales and 
presentation methods.


The main reason why I chose this program was because it gives me the opportunity to apply to different universities and allows for many transfer credits.
If I was not in the T127 program I'd probably be doing the Bachelor of Commerce – Culinary Management or Bachelor of Commerce – Financial Services.
